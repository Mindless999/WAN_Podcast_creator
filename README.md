# WAN_Podcast_creator
This is to create podcasts form the files created by floatplane downloader. 
The floatplane downloader you can find here: https://github.com/Inrixia/Floatplane-Downloader

Note that you will need to have an active subscription at floatplane to be able to use the downloader.

This script will need to know where you are picking the files, and where you want to put your podcasts. This is a format that Plex can use, and is available to be used in the PlexAMP app on your device.
